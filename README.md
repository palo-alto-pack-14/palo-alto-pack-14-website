# Pack 14 Website

A Jekyll-based website for Cub Scout Pack 14 in Palo Alto, CA.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Pack 14 website. The site is built using Jekyll, styled with TailwindCSS, and integrates with Google Calendar for event management.

We intend to create a more easily deployable template version of this site in the future. In the meantime, we've made this repository available to other Scouting America organizations so they can use it as a starting point for their own websites.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout using TailwindCSS
- **Event Management**: Integration with Google Calendar for public and private events
- **Downloadable Calendar Events**: Support for adding events to personal calendars (.ics)
- **Leadership Directory**: Information about pack leadership
- **Den Information**: Details about each den and meeting times

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.x
- Bundler

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pack14.git
   cd pack14
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   bundle install
   ```

3. Setup Google Calendar Integration
   - Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
   - Generate a key and save it as `gcalendar-key.json` in the root directory
   - Share your Google Calendar with the service account email
   - Update `_config.yml` with your calendar ID

### Development

Run the local development server:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Building for Production

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

This will generate the static site in the `_site` directory.

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch using GitHub Actions.

## Image Optimization

Built images are optimized during the GitHub Pages workflow by `script/optimize-images.sh`. This keeps the original source photos in the repository while shrinking the files that are actually deployed.

The current rules are intentionally simple:

- large hero and content JPEGs are resized to a practical maximum width and recompressed
- leader profile PNGs are resized aggressively because they are only displayed as small avatars
- metadata is stripped from generated assets

If you want to preview the optimized output locally after a build, run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
script/optimize-images.sh _site/assets/images
```

## Directory Structure

- `_config.yml`: Main Jekyll configuration
- `_layouts/`: Layout templates
- `_includes/`: Reusable components
- `assets/`: Static assets (images, CSS)
- `_site/`: Generated site (not in repository)
